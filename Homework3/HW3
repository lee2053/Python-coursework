From the Book, Chapter 4 Exercises:

4.13 (Write your solutions as Boolean conditions - they should evaluate to True or False)

4.16 (By dictionary order, they mean alphabetical order)

4.23 (to clarify, the function should take no arguments and should have an input statement within the function)

4.25

Additionally, complete 4.18 OR 4.20. 4.20 requires the use of the .format() method, which we haven't seen yet, but you can read the section starting on page 100 of your textbook.
